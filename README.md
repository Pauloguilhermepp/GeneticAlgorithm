# Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using the C++ language. An example of how to use it can be found in the Main.cpp file. Some of the parameters that can be modified for each execution of the algorithm are:

* **PopSize**: Size of the population.
* **NumGenerations**: Number of generations in the GA.
* **NumGenes**: Number of genes in the GA (number of variables).
* ***Fitness**: Function used to evaluate the elements of the population.
* **MinValue**: Minimum value of a variable in the elements of the population.
* **MaxValue**: Maximum value of a variable in the elements of the population.
* **MutationRate**: Rate of elements that will have a gene randomly modified by generation. 
* **MutationParam**: Parameter used in the mutation to update the value to a new one.
* **KTournament**: Number of elements compared in the tournament selection.
* **Crossover**: Type of crossover used in the algorithm.
